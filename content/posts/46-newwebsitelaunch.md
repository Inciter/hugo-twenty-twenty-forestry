The completely revamped Carson Research Consulting [web site](https://www.inciter.io/) showcases the talents and experiences of the CRC [team](https://www.inciter.io/who/crc-data-nerds) as well as the company’s expanded list of services. These offerings go beyond traditional research and evaluation services to include [database wrangling](https://www.inciter.io/what-we-do/methods/) and [data visualization](http://www.crcdataviz.com/). &nbsp;
&nbsp;Services are managed and delivered by experienced data and technology nerds, researchers and evaluators. The group’s strong work ethic and resourceful detective skills allow them to collect, organize, analyze and report on the data their clients need to explore, explain and improve their programs. And the new web site showcases the backgrounds, skills and experiences of each [team member](https://www.inciter.io/who/crc-data-nerds), including the new chief wellness officer.
&nbsp;“The web site,” says Taj Carson, CEO of CRC, “reflects our approachable and highly applicable way of doing evaluations and visualizing data. I am excited,” she adds, “to show clients how we can present their data in a way that is more engaging and effective.”
&nbsp;For many of CRC’s clients, managing their databases was a daily struggle, and several expressed concerns about the program data they put _into_ a database but had difficulty pulling _out_ of it. This was especially true when it came to aggregating data that would yield meaningful results. To address these issues, CRC began offering a full range of [database wrangling](https://www.inciter.io/what-we-do/methods/) services for their clients, from the first steps of data collection to the end result of a finished report.
&nbsp;The company’s database experience includes many popular software options, both online (such as Social Solutions’ ETO) and on desktop platforms (like Microsoft Access). This expertise allows CRC to teach their clients how to successful navigate the data retrieval and aggregation process. Or, if a client prefers, CRC can [manage](https://www.inciter.io/what-we-do/case-studies/database-customization/) their entire database and reports process, leaving their program managers to focus their full attention on their participants.
&nbsp;[Data Visualization](http://www.crcdataviz.com/) is another exciting new area for CRC, with clients working with them to develop interactive dashboards and infographics as well as web-based maps. Recently, CRC created an [infographic](http://www.crcdataviz.com/#!feast/c6eh) for [Moveable Feast](http://www.mfeast.org/), a non-profit in Maryland that prepares and delivers nutritious meals to homebound residents at no cost. The infographic showcases Moveable Feast’s upcoming 2014 Ride for the Feast, one of their largest fundraising events.
&nbsp;“This interactive graphic is exactly what we needed,” says Mellisa Colimore, Moveable Feast’s event manager. “And it lets us easily, clearly and creatively deliver the information for this year’s ride while describing just how extensive Moveable Feast’s services are.”
&nbsp;Another recent data visualization project was the creation of an [interactive map](http://crc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/OnePane/basicviewer/index.html?appid=098d93f6be494728b77baffe6a5e9e1c) of Baltimore City community schools for the Family League of Baltimore City. This map allows users to visualize a range of information, such as whether or not a particular school is slated for construction or if a school has an on-site health clinic. Users can also view the schools as an overlay with relevant community indicators, such as teen pregnancy and childhood lead exposure.
&nbsp;The clients served by CRC -- nonprofits, government agencies and foundations -- are passionate about the human services work they do, and they work with CRC because they want someone else to deal with the mounds of resulting data. These organizations see the value of partnering with a team of data-devotees who can help them understand the impact of their programs as well as how to improve them.&nbsp;
