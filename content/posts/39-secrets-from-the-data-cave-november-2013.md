<p align="center"><span style="color: #808080;"><i>Welcome to CRC’s monthly series of articles on all things techie:&nbsp;<b>Secrets from the Data Cave</b>! (For those who don’t know, the title references our room -- fondly referred to as “the bat cave”--- where data staff can geek out in an isolated setting.) Here we'll be offering you a fascinating sneak peek into the cave, with the latest updates &amp; tips on what we’re implementing here at CRC!</i></span></p>
<p align="center"><span style="font-size: large; color: #000000;"><b>November 2013: Why I’m Switching to Decaf</b></span></p>
<span style="color: #000000;">I’m kind of obsessed with tracking my progress to goals. And not just goals at work, or long-term goals in my personal life—I mean little, day-to-day things. I’ve even been known to track the amount of time I spend cleaning my apartment each day, because without documentation to keep me accountable, I would simply never clean. Obsessive, I know, but effective.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"><span style="color: #000000;">So I was super excited when I found this nifty website, which makes progress to a goal (or anything really) so easy to track that even non-data nerds are using it:</span>&nbsp;[www.askmeevery.com](http://www.askmeevery.com).</span>
<span style="color: #333333;"><span style="color: #000000;">You just enter your email address on the&nbsp;</span><a href="www.askmeevery.com" target="_blank"><span style="color: #333333;">AskMeEvery site</span></a><span style="color: #000000;">, type in a question for whatever it is you wish to track (like, “How many hours did I sleep last night?” or “How many miles did I run today?”), and you’ll get daily emails or text messages asking your question. All you have to do is reply to the email/text, and it will track the data for you!</span></span>
<span style="color: #000000;">I decided to record my productivity at the end of each workday, which meant that around 4 pm Monday through Friday, I’d get an email like this:</span>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<span style="color: #000000;">And after 2 weeks of this, I logged into the AskMeEvery site and it displayed my productivity ratings over time:</span>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
<span style="color: #000000;">But the coolest part is that you can compare the results of multiple questions, and analyze them to see if there is a statistically significant correlation. So I tossed in another variable:&nbsp;_how much coffee I had consumed each day._</span>
<span style="color: #000000;">And here’s what I found\*:</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="color: #000000;">So it seems that the&nbsp;__more__&nbsp;coffee I drink, the&nbsp;__LESS__&nbsp;productive I become.&nbsp;And that is why I will be switching to decaf!</span>
<span style="color: #000000;">__Check out&nbsp;<a href="www.askmeevery.com" target="_blank"><span style="color: #000000;">askmeevery.com</span></a>&nbsp;and let us know if you learn anything about yourself, and I’ll see you next month!__</span>
<span style="color: #333333;">&nbsp;\*Note: I realize that my methods are flawed here, but this is just for fun &nbsp;;)</span>
