<i>Welcome to CRCs monthly series of articles on all things techie: **Secrets from the Data Cave**! (For those who dont know, the title references our room -- fondly referred to as the bat cave--- where data staff can geek out in an isolated setting.) Here we'll be offering you a fascinating sneak peek into the cave, with the latest updates & tips on what were implementing here at CRC!</i>

**November 2013: Why Im Switching to Decaf**

## <img alt="Cup_of_coffee_with_beans" class="size-medium wp-image-1189 aligncenter" height="300" src="https://www.inciter.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Cup_of_coffee_with_beans-450x300.jpg" width="450"/>

Im kind of obsessed with tracking my progress to goals. And not just goals at work, or long-term goals in my personal lifeI mean little, day-to-day things. Ive even been known to track the amount of time I spend cleaning my apartment each day, because without documentation to keep me accountable, I would simply never clean. Obsessive, I know, but effective.

<span style="color: #000000;">So I was super excited when I found this nifty website, which makes progress to a goal (or anything really) so easy to track that even non-data nerds are using it: [www.askmeevery.com](http://www.askmeevery.com).

<span style="color: #000000;">You just enter your email address on the [AskMeEvery site](www.askmeevery.com), type in a question for whatever it is you wish to track (like, How many hours did I sleep last night? or How many miles did I run today?), and youll get daily emails or text messages asking your question. All you have to do is reply to the email/text, and it will track the data for you!

I decided to record my productivity at the end of each workday, which meant that around 4 pm Monday through Friday, Id get an email like this:

 [<img alt="email" class="aligncenter wp-image-962" height="202" src="https://www.inciter.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/email3.png" width="670"/>](https://www.inciter.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/email3.png)

And after 2 weeks of this, I logged into the AskMeEvery site and it displayed my productivity ratings over time:

[<span style="color: #000000;"><img alt="productivitychart" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-963" height="137" src="https://www.inciter.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/productivitychart1.png" width="858"/>](https://www.inciter.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/productivitychart1.png) 

But the coolest part is that you can compare the results of multiple questions, and analyze them to see if there is a statistically significant correlation. So I tossed in another variable: _how much coffee I had consumed each day._

And heres what I found\*:

 [<img alt="comparisonfinal" class="aligncenter wp-image-968" height="181" src="https://www.inciter.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/comparisonfinal3.png" width="748"/>](https://www.inciter.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/comparisonfinal3.png)

[<img alt="large effect" class="aligncenter wp-image-965" height="396" src="https://www.inciter.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/large-effect1.png" width="755"/>](https://www.inciter.io/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/large-effect1.png)

So it seems that the **more** coffee I drink, the **LESS** productive I become. And that is why I will be switching to decaf!

**Check out [<span style="color: #000000;">askmeevery.com](www.askmeevery.com) and let us know if you learn anything about yourself, and Ill see you next month!**

 \*Note: I realize that my methods are flawed here, but this is just for fun  ;)
