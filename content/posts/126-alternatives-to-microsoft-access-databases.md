What are the best modern alternatives to Microsoft Access Databases? Microsofts Access databases have historically dominated custom and semi-custom solutions for managing data, prototyping databases, and getting by with what you have since it was unveiled in 1992. While it has been the de facto custom database for almost 3 decades, it has not aged well in the era of the cloud. [Cue Lena Horne's iconic rendition of Stormy Weather...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JojZ9q0G1vs)

Since Access was first unveiled in 1992, many other players have entered the market. Nowadays there are a ton of excellent alternatives for databases, data management systems, and spreadsheets that are more than spreadsheets. They all fit somewhere on a continuum between [configuration and customization](https://www.sageintacct.com/blog/switching-cloud-configuration-vs-customization).

## Configuration vs. Customization

On the _**configuration**_ end of the continuum, there are what is called commercial off the shelf software or COTS. These are systems that do not allow for much customization, even though they may be highly configurable. One of the benefits that they offer is ease of implementation. These work great for common problems. A good example is a customer relationship platform (CRM). No-one needs to make their own CRM because so many excellent solutions are already available even for niche use cases.

On the _**customization**_ end of the continuum are platforms that often require a software developer or at least a very tech savvy power user. These are more expensive to build, maintain, and use (especially when a COTS solution already exists).

For over a decade Access has fit into the space between those two bookends. It provides the ability to customize within a standard tabular structure. Its sort of like spreadsheets PLUS.

Unfortunately, Microsoft has not been in active development for new Access features. [They do however still maintain it for basic bug fixes and will continue to do so in the newest version until at least 2025 (as of writing, 12/15/2020).](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/search/915) While other services (Word/Excel/Outlook/etc.) have been translated to the cloud, there are no current public plans for doing so with Access.

### Why not Access databases?

Securely maintaining an Access database has become more cumbersome and IT departments these days are often overwhelmed with other projects. Ironically, one of the biggest challenges is that it is difficult to allow access to Access databases when you are working remotely as we often are these days. Well designed cloud solutions offer better security, reliability, and accessibility than locally managed software and systems like Access. For these reasons and others, folks are moving away from Access for tracking their data.

We talk with clients all the time about replacing their Access databases. Below are some of the options we review to see if they fit the clients needs. The list is by no means complete, so if you have an Access database that you need to replace, [schedule a free 30 minute consultation with us to discuss your options using this link.](https://meetings.hubspot.com/taj10)

## Replacing Microsoft Access Databases

### On the configurable/COTS/off-the-shelf side of the continuum, there are tons of alternatives to Access databases.

*   CRMs*   [Hubspot](https://www.hubspot.com/pricing/marketing)*   [CiviCRM](https://civicrm.org/)*   [SalsaCRM](https://www.salsalabs.com/)*   _**... many many more**_
*   Donor Management Systems*   [Raiser's Edge](https://www.blackbaud.com/products/blackbaud-raisers-edge-nxt)*   [Donor Perfect](https://www.donorperfect.com/fundraising-software/pricing-guide/)*   [Bloomerang](https://bloomerang.co/pricing)*   _**... many many more**_
*   Social Media scheduling systems... Medical Record Systems... _**so many more...**_
*   Pretty much any software where there are lots of mature options in the marketplace fall into this category.
*   These make a lot of decisions for you and help your organization use best practices by not allowing you to veer too far from the path.

### In between configurable and customizable extremes are the "spreadsheet+" alternatives to Access databases.

*   Examples:*   [Grist - a well organized service that is fairly easy to use and build your own "app" that is also a spreadsheet](https://www.getgrist.com/pricing)*   [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/) +[ Google Apps Scripts - the standard for collaborative spreadsheets with the ability to add plugins and customizations](https://developers.google.com/apps-script)*   [Airtable - the epitome of "spreadsheets+" and it allows for complex data relationships](https://airtable.com/pricing)*   [Smartsheet - the standard for spreadsheets that aren't Google or Microsoft](https://www.smartsheet.com/pricing)*   _**... many many more**_
*   These are more flexible than configurable/COTS/off-the-shelf solutions.
*   What they have in common is that they all share the visual familiarity of  spreadsheets but do much more.
*   These are EXCELLENT for prototyping when you aren't sure what type of system you need.
*   Security should be a concern with these. Google Sheets and Smartsheet _**can be**_ HIPAA compliant for instance, but they _**are not**_ compliant out of the box. Compliance requires **additional** **work, training and configuration.**

### On the customizable end of the continuum, there are "platforms" and low-code/no-code alternatives to Access databases.

*   "Platform" Examples:*   [Incite DMS](https://www.inciter.io/)        *   More about this in the _**Where Inciter Fits In**_ section below.    *   This is Inciter's in-house system.    *   Incite DMS fits when you need a powerful, flexible, secure, and low-maintenance data system to track things that are hard to track.            *   [Parse server](https://parseplatform.org/)        *   Requires adeveloper, but it's very flexible and fully open sourced.    *   Originally developed by Facebook but we wont hold that against it. :)            *   [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/editions-pricing/overview/)        *   While people know Salesforce as a "CRM", it's actually quite a lot more than that...    *   It's an ecosystem... it's a platform... it's a bird.... it's a plane... it's expensive.... it's Salesforce! ?            
*   Low-code/No-code Examples:*   [Bubble.io - the "OG" of low-code/no-code](https://bubble.io/pricing)*   [Honeycode - AWS's take on low-code/no-code](https://www.honeycode.aws/pricing)*   [Google Appsheet - Google's take on low-code/no-code](https://www.appsheet.com/)*   [Nucode - service to help you get started with low-code/no-code](https://www.nucode.co/)*   Low-code/no-code tools have been gaining steam lately. As they become more powerful, they often overlap the spreadsheet+ category. They usually allow for extensive customization.
*   [TechRepublic article: Is low-code/no-code the future of application development?](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/is-low-codeno-code-the-future-of-application-development/)
*   These can be both configured and customized readily by super users or power users think of your colleague or friend that you always go to when you need tech help they frequently have the right skills to set these up.
*   [For any of you "super users" and "power users" out there... if you feel a bit insecure about your abilities, take a look at this Wired article describing the value of database developers.](https://www.wired.com/story/databases-coding-real-programming-myth/)
