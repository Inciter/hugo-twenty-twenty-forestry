#Content

Several weeks ago, one of our clients came to us with a challenge:__ find compelling ways to present 10 years of grantmaking data.__ The client wanted us to tell their story and present the data&nbsp;in a way that&nbsp;people at all levels (data nerds and non-data nerds)&nbsp;at their organization could easily understand.

I was tasked with analyzing the data and worked closely with the&nbsp;CRC dataviz experts, [Taj](https://www.inciter.io/who/crc-data-nerds/taj/) and [Matthew](https://www.inciter.io/who/crc-data-nerds/matthew/),&nbsp;to come up with the different visuals for the report. I'm no dataviz expert but here's what I learned:
*   __Client feedback is important:__ Take time to hear your client's thoughts on the visualizations you are creating, you want to make sure you are meeting your client's expectations.
*   __Patience is key:__ I spent a lot of time creating and re-creating multiple charts and graphs. It takes time to make sure every visual aligns with the story you are trying to tell. If you need a break, eat a muffin.
*   __Don't be afraid to ask for help:__ If you get stuck, ask a colleague or check out online forums to see if there is a solution to the problem you're having. Google is&nbsp;a great friend.
*   __Sketch!:__ Take time to sketch out what you want your visuals to look like. Trust me, it'll save you a lot of time in the end.
*   __Don't be afraid to try:__ I made about 40-50 visuals for this project. Around&nbsp;half were rejected by the design team but I learned a lot throughout the process:
    
    *   Pie charts are not your friend
    *   No one at CRC likes pink or mustard yellow
    *   Embrace white space
    *   Not every visualization&nbsp;needs to be a bar graph
    *   Embrace awesomeness
    
    
    

In the end, we created a pretty cool report for our client that they really liked. Since we can't share the report online for proprietary purposes, we created a similar report for this blog.
