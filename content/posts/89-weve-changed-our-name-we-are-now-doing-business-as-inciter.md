We have exciting news to share with you - weve changed our name!

We are now doing business as Inciter. 

We are undertaking the same quality work, with the same great staff, and a fun new product  Incite - which means expanded opportunities for all.&lt; 

 Established in 2003 as Carson Research Consulting, Inciter is still a small, woman-owned firm located in Baltimore, MD. When you work with Inciter, you continue to get a team of experienced researchers, evaluators, and custom software designers. While we are located on the East Coast, we work across the country. Inciters mission is to make it easy for nonprofit organizations, foundations, and government agencies to harness data and use it to communicate findings to funders, stakeholders, and staff. Inciter has the knowledge and experience to help clients do it all - measure impact, communicate, and fundraise through research and evaluation, data visualization, and data systems utilizing our new custom-built data system, Incite. Incite is a cloud-based, software-as-a-service platform designed to enter, store, and create reports on client data and program activities for nonprofits, foundations, social service agencies, and K-12 education. Incite provides a portal accessible via desktop or mobile devices for entering data about people, looking up records, and creating reports for funders and decision makers. We built Incite for you - our network of clients and partners. We've been there  frustrated by data management software options because we didn't love what we saw, so we built our own custom software to gather, manage, and report on data. Our data system works because we know our customers. We understand the work you do because weve been helping you wrangle data for over 15 years. We built Incite after extensive user testing to make sure it was easy for our clients, and because we are data geeks, you know we made sure that the data stored there is as accurate as it can be, and that especially includes the reports that come out of Incite. We love what we do. We have a passion for data, and for making a difference. And we look forward to continue our working relationship as Inciter. Find us at [Inciter.io](http://www.inciter.io)
