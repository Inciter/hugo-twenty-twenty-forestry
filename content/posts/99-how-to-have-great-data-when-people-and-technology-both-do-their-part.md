The [American Evaluation Association](http://www.eval.org) is celebrating **Getting Great Data Week**. All posts on [AEA365](https://aea365.org) this week are contributed by evaluators who came together to write about the theme of getting data that is accurate, timely and, most of all, useful.

Our own Taj Carson contributed this timely post: [https://aea365.org/blog/getting-great-data-week-how-to-have-great-data-when-people-and-technology-both-do-their-part-by-taj-carson/](https://aea365.org/blog/getting-great-data-week-how-to-have-great-data-when-people-and-technology-both-do-their-part-by-taj-carson/)
