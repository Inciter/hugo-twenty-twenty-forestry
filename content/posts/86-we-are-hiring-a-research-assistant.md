**if. . .**

	You are described by friends and co-workers as "kick ass," in the nicest possible way. You are competent, creative, trustworthy, engaging, organized, and an all-around people-person.	You love Baltimore and the idea of working in and engaging Baltimore community organizations and residents.	You love numbers and data, but you understand that people who provide social services dont, and often make a mess of them. And youd like to be one that helps them sort it out.	You are a fiend for details, enjoy entering and analyzing data, organizing minutiae and making order out of chaos.	You are a juggling genius and master of the deadline, and like the idea of being someones right hand to support them in running complex projects.	You show up to every meeting at least five minutes before it starts.	You have a background in community psychology, public health, social work or the like.
