&nbsp;

•	You are described by friends and co-workers as "kick ass," in the nicest possible way. You are competent, creative, trustworthy, engaging, organized, and an all-around people-person.•	You love Baltimore and the idea of working in and engaging Baltimore community organizations and residents.•	You love numbers and data, but you understand that people who provide social services don’t, and often make a mess of them. And you’d like to be one that helps them sort it out.•	You are a fiend for details, enjoy entering and analyzing data, organizing minutiae and making order out of chaos.•	You are a juggling genius and master of the deadline, and like the idea of being someone’s right hand to support them in running complex projects.•	You show up to every meeting at least five minutes before it starts.•	You have a background in community psychology, public health, social work or the like.

About the position
&nbsp;
 This is a full-time position, and requires you to work at our office in Hampden. If you want to work at home when there is three feet of snow on the ground, you should have the setup for that (internet and your own computer) because we don’t take snow days, although we do have liberal vacation and holidays. In other words, you can’t skip work because it snows, but we will make sure you have plenty of time off to recharge.
