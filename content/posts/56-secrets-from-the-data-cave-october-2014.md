<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Welcome to CRC’s monthly series of articles on all things techie: Secrets from the Data Cave! (For those who don’t know, the title references our room — fondly referred to as “the bat cave”— where data staff can geek out in an isolated setting.) Here we’ll be offering you a fascinating sneak peek into the cave, with the latest updates &amp; tips on what we’re implementing here at CRC!</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Access vs. Excel: Which Will Reign Supreme&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 14pt;"><em>(for your storage needs)</em></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Access and its less showy cousin, Excel, are both good options for data storage. In this installment of Secrets from the Data Cave, I'll highlight some things to consider when deciding between using Excel and Access for your data storage needs.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Then again, if you do not know how to use Access already, it can be intimidating to learn a new program. If that’s you, then I would encourage you to check out this free, 12-part tutorial on Youtube to learn the basics of Access. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMzf6u8hWqk" target="_blank">You can find the first video here</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>A brief rundown of key considerations</strong></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>EXCEL works well for</em>:</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>Computing aggregate totals from a single, flat data source (an example of this would be answers given to a single questionnaire or a table of demographic info)</li>
<li>Computing totals and/or organizing information where you have a single common identifier on everything (e.g., if you have a bunch of forms completed by clients, but every form has the client’s driver’s license number on it)</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;">Please note that even in the above cases, you’ll need a pretty firm grasp of how to write Excel functions in order to get the results you may need.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em>ACCESS works well for:</em></p>
<ul><li style="text-align: left;">Integrating many different data sources relating to one central population (e.g, many different datasets that all give information about the clients your program serves)</li><li style="text-align: left;">Computing totals and organizing information when you have many different identifiers (such as if some of your forms have clients’ driver’s license numbers on them, but other forms just have the last 4 digits of their SSN, you need a relational database that can match up your client list to any and all IDs that correspond to particular people)</li></ul>
