_by [Sheila Matano](https://www.inciter.io/who/crc-data-nerds/sheila/)_

Last week, I attended the **<span style="color: #ff6600;">[EYEO festival](http://eyeofestival.com/) **for the first time. EYEO is unique in that it brings together experts from a wide variety of fields (e.g. computer science, engineering, data design, cartography, etc.) to showcase their work.  There were a number of great presentations, and below are some of my favorites.

**Sarah Williams: DigitalMatatus, Visualizing Informality**

Sarah Williams is currently an Assistant Professor of Urban Planning and the Director of the <span style="color: #ff6600;">[Civic Data Design Lab](http://www.civicdatadesignlab.org/) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technologys School of Architecture and Planning. The Civic Data Design Lab employs data visualization and mapping techniques to expose and communicate urban patterns and policy issues to broader audiences. In her presentation, Sarah talked about how her team worked with Kenyan Universities and Nairobis growing technology sector to collect data on Nairobis transit system which is mostly made up of [None](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matatu). As a Nairobi native, it was pretty awesome to hear how Sarah and her team used this information to develop mobile routing applications and design a new [transit map](http://www.digitalmatatus.com/) for Nairobi that changed how both the residents and government navigate the system.

**Nicholas Felton: Too Big to Fail**

<span style="color: #ff6600;">[Nicholas Felton](http://feltron.com/) is famous for his personal annual reports that incorporate different dataviz techniques to reflect his work. The image below is from the [Feltron 2012 Annual Report](http://feltron.com/ar12_01.html).

In his presentation, Felton described how he attempted to capture a year of his communication exchanges in 2013 including conversations, phone calls, physical mail, email, texts and chat messages. He also talked about the methodology, privacy issues and design challenges of working with this dataset. You can keep up with his work on his <span style="color: #ff6600;">[blog](http://feltron.tumblr.com/).

He manages the media arts education program for the Rap Research Lab-a place for teaching art, design, data analysis and data visualization to students from the Bronx using his project based curriculum which visualizes Hip Hop as a cultural indicator.  During his presentation, Hemphill talked about his work in the semantic analysis of rap lyrics and how he used a robot to create visualizations by mapping the locations rappers mentioned in their music.

**Micah Elizabeth Scott: Blinky lights for STEAM**

<span style="color: #ff6600;">[Micah Elizabeth Scott](Micah%2520Elizabeth%2520Scott)  talked about her experience working with both hardware and software. She has been doing unconventional things with technology for as long as she can remember and has built satellites, robots, virtual machines, graphics drivers, CPU emulators, networking stacks, USB controllers, reverse engineering tools, and pretty much everything in-between.  In her presentation, Micah talked about her work in using LEDs to bridge the gap between technology and art, and the potential this new medium has as an open-ended educational tool. This year, her and her team at [scanlime](http://scanlime.org/) took a cloud to [burning man on a forklift](http://scanlime.org/2013/09/the-ardent-mobile-cloud-platform/).

<span style="color: #ff6600;">[Jessica Hagy](http://jessicahagy.info/books/) is an artist and writer best known for her Webby award-winning blog,[ Indexed](http://thisisindexed.com/). A fixture in the creative online space, her style of visual storytelling allows readers to draw their own conclusions and to actively participate in each narrative. She mixes data (both quantitative and qualitative) with humor, insight, and simple visuals to make even the most complex concepts immediately accessible and relevant. During her presentation, Jessica shared some of the humorous stories behind her visualizations.

**Taj Carson: Everyone deserves beautiful data**

<span style="color: #ff6600;">[Taj](https://www.inciter.io/who/crc-data-nerds/taj/) gave a great ignite presentation on why everyone deserves beautiful data. She gave us some insight on how data visualization can be made accessible to people or organizations who dont have a lot of resources. We will post a link to her presentation when its available.

**Northern spark festival**

<span style="color: #ff6600;">[Northern Spark](http://2014.northernspark.org/) is an all-night arts festival that happens on the second Saturday in June each summer. Tens of thousands of people gather along the Minneapolis riverfront and throughout the city to explore giant video projections, play in temporary installations in the streets, and enjoy experimental performances in green spaces and under bridges. I had a great time exploring the Minneapolis art scene, below are some of the installations.
