<span style="color: #000000;">Last week, I attended the __<span style="color: #ff6600;">[EYEO festival](http://eyeofestival.com/) </span>__for the first time. EYEO is unique in that it brings together experts from a wide variety of fields (e.g. computer science, engineering, data design, cartography, etc.) to showcase their work.&nbsp; There were a number of great presentations, and below are some of my favorites.</span>
&nbsp;
<span style="color: #000000;">__Sarah Williams: DigitalMatatus, Visualizing Informality__</span>
<span style="color: #000000;">Sarah Williams is currently an Assistant Professor of Urban Planning and the Director of the <span style="color: #ff6600;">[Civic Data Design Lab](http://www.civicdatadesignlab.org/) </span>at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s School of Architecture and Planning. The Civic Data Design Lab employs data visualization and mapping techniques to expose and communicate urban patterns and policy issues to broader audiences. In her presentation, Sarah talked about how her team worked with Kenyan Universities and Nairobi’s growing technology sector to collect data on Nairobi’s transit system which is mostly made up of <span style="color: #ff6600;">[None](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matatu)</span>. As a Nairobi native, it was pretty awesome&nbsp;to hear how Sarah and her team used this information to develop mobile routing applications and design a new <span style="color: #ff6600;">[transit map](http://www.digitalmatatus.com/)</span> for Nairobi that changed how both the residents and government navigate the system.</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">__Nicholas Felton: Too Big to Fail__</span>
<span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #ff6600;">[Nicholas Felton](http://feltron.com/)</span> is famous for his personal annual reports that incorporate different dataviz techniques to reflect his work. The image below is from the <span style="color: #ff6600;">[Feltron 2012 Annual Report](http://feltron.com/ar12_01.html)</span>.</span>
<span style="color: #000000;">In his presentation, Felton described how he attempted to capture a year of his communication exchanges in 2013 including conversations, phone calls, physical mail, email, texts and chat messages. He also talked about the methodology, privacy issues and design challenges of working with this dataset. You can keep up with his work on his <span style="color: #ff6600;">[blog](http://feltron.tumblr.com/)</span>.</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">__Tahir Hemphill: The Rap Research Lab__</span>

He manages the media arts education program for the Rap Research Lab-a place for teaching art, design, data analysis and data visualization to students from the Bronx using his project based curriculum which visualizes Hip Hop as a cultural indicator.&nbsp; During his presentation, Hemphill talked about his work in the semantic analysis of rap lyrics and how he used a robot to create visualizations by mapping the locations rappers mentioned in their music.</span>

<span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #ff6600;">[Micah Elizabeth Scott](Micah%2520Elizabeth%2520Scott) </span>&nbsp;talked about her experience working with both hardware and software. She has been doing unconventional things with technology for as long as she can remember and has built satellites, robots, virtual machines, graphics drivers, CPU emulators, networking stacks, USB controllers, reverse engineering tools, and pretty much everything in-between. &nbsp;In her presentation, Micah talked about her work in using LEDs to bridge the gap between technology and art, and the potential this new medium has as an open-ended educational tool. This year, her and her team at <span style="color: #ff6600;">[scanlime](http://scanlime.org/)</span> took a cloud to <span style="color: #ff6600;">[burning man on a forklift](http://scanlime.org/2013/09/the-ardent-mobile-cloud-platform/)</span>.</span>

She gave us some insight on how data visualization can be made accessible to people or organizations who don’t have a lot of resources. We will post a link to her presentation when it’s available.</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">__Northern spark festival__</span>
<span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #ff6600;">[Northern Spark](http://2014.northernspark.org/) </span>is an all-night arts festival that happens on the second Saturday in June each summer. Tens of thousands of people gather along the Minneapolis riverfront and throughout the city to explore giant video projections, play in temporary installations in the streets, and enjoy experimental performances in green spaces and under bridges. I had a great time exploring the Minneapolis art scene, below are some of the installations.&nbsp;</span>

The Clock samples thousands of excerpts from the history of film that indicate the passage of time—from clock towers to wristwatches to buzzing alarm clocks—that the artist has edited together to unfold on the screen in real time as a 24-hour montage.</span>&nbsp;
