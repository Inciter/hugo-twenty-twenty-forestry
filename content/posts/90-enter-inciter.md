Have you ever known just what to do to make a project work, but you couldnt find the right tools to make it happen? 

We've been there  frustrated by data management software options because we didn't love what we saw, so we built our own custom software - named Incite - to gather, manage, and report on data. 

Enter our company, Inciter. 

Inciters mission is to make it easy for nonprofit organizations, foundations, and government agencies to harness data and use it to communicate findings to funders, stakeholders and staff. 

Inciter helps clients measure impact, communicate, and fundraise through research, visualization, and data systems. Inciter helps clients change the world by using data to tell the story of their impact, raise funds, and advocate for social change. We do this by helping them collect the right information, at the right time, using the right tools, and turning it into powerful products that they can use to communicate about their impact, advocate for their cause, and raise funds. 

We love what we do. We have a passion for data, and for making a difference. 

Established in 2003 as Carson Research Consulting, Inciter is a small, woman-owned firm located in Baltimore, MD. When you work with Inciter, you get a team of experienced researchers, evaluators, and custom software designers. While we are located on the East Coast, we work across the country. 

Data is at the core of everything we do. We work with clients to make sure they are collecting the right data, design surveys and other instruments to collect it, use Incite to enter, store and report on that data, and create beautiful products using data visualization to get the right information to the right audience for that client. We combine research skills, design and visualization skills, and software development skills to bring you the best tools wrangle your data, no matter what stage of the process you are at. 

Were proud of our exceptional research and evaluation expertise, and even prouder of our easy to use data system that pulls it all together. And we use all of it to make research productive anddare we say itfun. Were not just a bunch of number crunchers sitting behind computers ready to throw data at people and send them on their way. 

Inciter has the knowledge and experience to help clients do it all - measure impact, communicate, and fundraise through research and evaluation, data visualization, and data systems utilizing our new custom-built data system, Incite.
