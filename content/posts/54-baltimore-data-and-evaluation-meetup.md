The [Baltimore Data and Evaluation Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Baltimore-Evaluation-Meetup/), recently created by CRC, is a group for people working at nonprofits, foundations, and government agencies who are interested in collecting and using data to improve their programs. Whether you are trying to figure out where to start, wrestling with providing data to funders, figuring out what outcomes you should be measuring, or analyzing and reporting on the data you already collect, this meetup is for you. All levels of expertise are welcome. Participants will discuss the issues they are facing and share ideas and resources in order to practically solve problems. At least one skilled evaluation professional will be present at every session. We are hoping to develop a group where people from different organizations can bring questions about evaluation, share ideas, and build a community around data collection, outcome measurement, and reporting.

Please join us for our first meeting on Wednesday, September 3, 2014 from 8:00 to 9:00 AM at Maryland Nonprofits, 1500 Union Avenue, Suite 2500, Baltimore, MD. We plan to have a discussion about potential topics for the rest of this year's meetups. A light breakfast will be served.

Don't forget to RSVP [here](http://www.meetup.com/Baltimore-Evaluation-Meetup/events/198420022/).
