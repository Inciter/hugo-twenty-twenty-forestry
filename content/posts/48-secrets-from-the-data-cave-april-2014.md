<p align="center"><span style="color: #808080;"><i>Welcome to CRC’s monthly series of articles on all things techie:&nbsp;<b>Secrets from the Data Cave</b>! (For those who don’t know, the title references our room — fondly referred to as “the bat cave”— where data staff can geek out in an isolated setting.) Here we’ll be offering you a fascinating sneak peek into the cave, with the latest updates &amp; tips on what we’re implementing here at CRC!</i></span></p>
<p align="center"><span style="color: #333333; font-size: medium;"><b>April 2014: &nbsp;Building Online Brochures for Dummies</b></span></p>
<p align="center" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: small; color: #333333;">Let’s be frank: print advertising is going the way of the Dodo bird (RIP Mr. Dodo).&nbsp;Pamphlets, flyers, and brochures received in the mail(or in-person from a persistent kiosk salesperson while you’re walking through the mall,&nbsp;<i>just trying to get your coffee fix</i>) typically end up in the recycling bin or in a giant stack on your dining room table.</span></p>

 <span style="color: #333333;">You know you have a pile like this at home, admit it!</span>[/caption]
<span style="color: #333333;">&nbsp;So, what’s a better way for companies and organizations to effectively spread the word about their services and products?</span>
<span style="color: #333333;">_Drumroll, please…_</span>
<span style="color: #333333;">I present to you, <a href="http://www.simplebooklets.com" target="_blank"><span style="color: #ff6600;"><span style="color: #ff6600;">Simplebooklet</span></span></a>. This handy website allows you to easily build online brochures (or “booklets”, as they call them) in a matter of minutes. Even the most HTML-illiterate person can make a brochure without pulling their hair out, as the process is 100% click-and-choose with no code-writing involved.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;">I signed up for a free trial, which gave me 10 booklets that will be available online for 14 days. You can upgrade your account to the “Hero” service, which for $48 allows your 10 booklets to remain available online for a year. The “Client Manager” account gives you 30 booklets and 5 client accounts at a cost of $120/year. Or, choose “Full Service” where you supply a digital version (PDF, Word document, etc.) of your material and they transform it into a booklet for you (price available on request from Simplebooklit).</span>
<span style="color: #333333;">You can design a booklet from scratch (which isn’t as difficult as it sounds!) or use one of their several templates including “Top 5”, which highlights the top benefits of your products and services. I experimented with the “Business Overview” template to create a quick <span style="color: #ff6600;">[Carson Research booklet](http://midd.me/8Ri7)</span>. This is just an elementary example of what you can do – the possibilities are nearly endless! &nbsp;The site allows you to make a minimalist, muted brochure, a vibrantly-colored one full of images, or anything in-between. And, as you work out the style that fits your needs, every time you edit the booklet it will automatically update it wherever you have shared/posted it.</span>
<span style="color: #333333;">And good news for data heads like us. Simplebooklit allows you to check the analytics – how many views your booklet has had, and how many social media shares so you can be sure that your electronic brochure has not ended up in the internet garbage dump. </span>
<span style="color: #333333;">Try your hand at making a booklet and let us know what you think!</span>
