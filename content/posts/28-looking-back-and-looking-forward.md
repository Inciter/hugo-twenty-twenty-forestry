Carson Research has had an exciting and productive 2012, and we're thankful for our clients, friends, families, and evaluation colleagues, who were an integral part of our successes this year!

Of all the developments that have taken place, one of the most noticeable is the growth of our team, and the diversification of our skill set that has come along with our new team members.

**Looking towards the New Year, we'd like to share how each CRC staffer chose to complete the following statement:**

_Next year, I plan to enhance my evaluation skills by...._

Jill: learning more about state-of-the-art evaluation and data visualization strategies.

Sheila: improving my data visualization skills.

Leslie: making more time to stay up-to-date on the latest evaluation research.

Matthania: working on tasks that will expose me to new and relevant research.

Mandi: more readily applying my academic knowledge of evaluation to the practical, real world uses.

Taj: continuing to explore ways for my clients to use technology to have better access to their data and evaluation findings.

Jackie: increasing my knowledge of Excel.

Kathy (not pictured): improving my grant skills.

(We would also like to take this opportunity to thank departing staffer Jenn Prichard for her many contributions to our team this year. Good luck, Jenn, in all of your future pursuits!)

Wishing you a prosperous New Year and the very best for your own evaulation efforts in 2013!

Taj & the CRC team
