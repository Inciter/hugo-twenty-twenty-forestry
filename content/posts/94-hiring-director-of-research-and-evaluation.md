#Content

At Inciter, we help clients measure impact, communicate, and fundraise through research, visualization, and data systems. Were proud of our exceptional research and evaluation expertise (to say nothing of our enthusiasm for color coding), and we use all of that to make research productive and even (dare we say) fun. Were not just a bunch of number crunchers sitting behind computers ready to throw data at people and send them on their way. We love what we do. We have a passion for data, and for making a difference.

As a consulting firm, we work with clients large and small, including foundations and nonprofits. We we work with clients in many areas, including public health, education, housing, workforce development, and many others. Most (but not all) of our clients are located in the mid-Atlantic region.

We specialize in applied research. That means people actually use our work to make programs and services better and to make strategic decision. We have a collegial attitude and company culture--doing great work for our clients and having fun along the way. Check us out on the web, FB and Twitter and see for yourself.
