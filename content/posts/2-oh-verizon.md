<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Verizon suffers from the basic inability to pretend they care that you don't have service (See, if you don't care, at least fake it. Sometimes they give you a lackluster "I'm sorry". Verizon regularly violates __rule number one__ of addressing customer complaints, "Be accessible to your customers". When people have to wait 30 minutes to speak to someone, they are in a bad mood and are less likely to purchase from you again, even before you have a chance to resolve their issue! Customers expect things to go wrong, so if you handle that first call well you can keep them, or even make them think better of you because you were able to be so helpful. </span>
<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Unfortunately, over 30 percent of customers don't get things resolved in the first call. And if you are a Verizon customer, you might never get things resolved. I didn't, and now I'm with Cavalier. </span>
