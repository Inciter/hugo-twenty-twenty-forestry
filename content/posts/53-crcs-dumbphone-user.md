<p style="padding-left: 120px; text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">Each CRC staff person is assigned a month in which to write a blog – this month it was my turn. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px; text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">At first, I was wracking my brain to come up with something instructive, like in my colleague <a href="https://www.inciter.io/secrets-from-the-data-cave-may-2014/" target="_blank">Sarah’s series <em>Secrets from the Data Cave</em></a>, or hip like <a href="https://www.inciter.io-takes-detroit/" target="_blank">Sheila’s post about Data Driven Detroit</a>. </span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px; text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">Instead, I decided to write about something &nbsp;that sets me apart from my co-workers, and tell a little story about our office in the process.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px; text-align: left;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #000000;">The other day I was checking office voicemail online (we have an internet phone system) and came across this funny-looking icon. I noted how non-self-explanatory this icon was and, out of curiosity, asked a few co-workers if they knew what it meant. The conversation went a little something like this:</span></p>
<span style="color: #000000;">Me: “Hey, does anyone know what this ridiculous icon that looks like 110 camera film is?”</span>
<span style="color: #000000;">
</span>
<span style="color: #000000;">Co-worker \#1: “Seriously?........That’s the international voicemail symbol – it’s been around for decades.”_ \[Note: co-worker \#1 is in her early 20’s\]_</span>
<span style="color: #000000;">Me: “Decades……. really?”</span>
<span style="color: #000000;">Co-worker \#2: “Haha, co-worker \#1, you haven’t even been around for decades! But yes, that is the voicemail icon.”</span>
<span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;Co-worker \#1: “Well, it’s the only voicemail symbol I’ve seen in my entire life. It’s on EVERY cell phone”</span>
<span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;Me: “Well, it isn’t on mine. When I have a voicemail on my cell, it looks like a phone handset.”</span>
<span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;Co-worker \#2: “No way, you have it – you just don’t know.”</span>
<span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;Me: “Call me and leave a voicemail…I’ll prove it to you.”</span>
<span style="color: #000000;"> This conversation continued. Co-worker \#1 called and left a message on my phone. Sure enough – no 110 film icon appeared; just an old-school phone handset (much to everyone’s shock and amusement). Another co-worker chimed in this time, looking over her shoulder and brushing away tears of laughter from her eyes……“OMG, I had your phone in like 1996!”</span>
<span style="color: #000000;">Admittedly, I’m the technology dinosaur in our office. I’m in my late 30’s and the proud owner of a “dumbphone”. I also stay away from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and all the other social media that I know nothing about. I’ve faced my fair share of ridicule in the office because of this, but the voicemail conversation took the cake.</span>
<span style="color: #000000;">I’ve been asked, “In our work environment, how can you NOT have a smartphone?” My answer, most simply is….“I don’t want one. Well, not yet.” It’s not that getting a smartphone has not crossed my mind, but I’m ambivalent about it and I never considered owning one until I started working here over a year ago. So at this point, I’m weighing the pros and cons. Here is my list so far:</span>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #000000;">Pros</span></p>
<ul style="padding-left: 60px;"><li><span style="color: #000000;">Email access anywhere, anytime.</span></li><li><span style="color: #000000;">Internet access anywhere, anytime</span></li><li><span style="color: #000000;">Capturing video and still photos of local Hampdenites sparring outside our office windows</span></li><li><span style="color: #000000;">Apps claiming to organize and simplify my life</span></li></ul>
<ul style="padding-left: 60px;"><li><span style="color: #000000;">Email access anywhere, anytime</span></li><li><span style="color: #000000;">Cost<br/></span></li><li><span style="color: #000000;">Learning curve</span></li><li><span style="color: #000000;">Having a phone dictate my life</span></li><li><span style="color: #000000;">Auto correct (I have nightmares about sending inappropriate emails to clients. With my luck, I’d have the next contribution to the website <a href="http://www.damnyouautocorrect.com/"><span style="color: #000000;">Damn You Auto Correct</span></a>)</span></li></ul>
<span style="color: #000000;">  
&nbsp;</span>
<span style="color: #000000;">The cons still outweigh the pros for me right now; I’m just not ready for a smart phone quite yet. Plus, have you read the article recently published in _Science_\[1\] about people who would rather shock themselves than be without their phones or other devices? I’m not itching to jump on that bandwagon! </span>
<span style="color: #000000;">Anyway, I like to think I make out just fine without a smartphone. I’ve never missed a meeting, I meet my deadlines, and have a means for getting in touch with people and for people to get in touch with me. Everyone has their own style. Mine just might be a bit more old-school than others. I mean, really, I DO text!</span>
